# DevPayr PHP SDK

A lightweight and developer-friendly PHP SDK for integrating the [DevPayr](https://devpayr.com) platform â€” allowing you to validate license keys, fetch injectables, manage projects, control domains, enforce payments, and more.

Designed for software creators, SaaS founders, and digital product developers who want to secure and monetize their code with minimal effort.

## ðŸ”° Introduction

DevPayr is a modern software licensing and payment enforcement platform built to help developers protect their code, enforce payment, and control how their software is used â€” across PHP, JavaScript, desktop, and SaaS environments.

This SDK enables seamless integration with DevPayr directly from your PHP application. Whether you're selling a script, distributing software, or building a SaaS, this SDK gives you the tools to:

- Validate license keys and enforce runtime restrictions
- Download and decrypt injectables (e.g., encrypted config or code blobs)
- Interact with your DevPayr projects, licenses, and domains
- Enforce project payment before allowing usage

### ðŸš€ Why Use DevPayr SDK?

Manually enforcing license checks, domain locks, and payment validation can be error-prone, time-consuming, and easily bypassed.

The DevPayr SDK solves this with:

âœ… **One-Line Bootstrapping** â€“ Validate license, check payment, auto-handle injectables in a single call  
âœ… **Secure Runtime Validation** â€“ Block unauthorized use and unpaid projects at runtime  
âœ… **Customizable Failure Modes** â€“ Redirect, log, silently fail, or show a branded modal on license failure  
âœ… **Injectable Decryption** â€“ Distribute sensitive data like config, templates, or code snippets securely  
âœ… **Developer-Friendly API** â€“ Create, revoke, validate licenses and domains easily from your app  
âœ… **Built-in Caching** â€“ Avoid repeated license checks with intelligent cache

Whether you're distributing self-hosted scripts, WordPress plugins, SaaS dashboards, or internal tools â€” DevPayr SDK brings enforcement, control, and peace of mind.
